Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I've been able to create a starting sequence for the player and lead them to different paths that either present them with new opportunities or death.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I haven't been able to create a lot of paths for the player to explore and I haven't been able to include some type of chance into the game.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

The only problems I've encountered have come from lack of knowledge. After researching, I've been able to find the answer to my problems. I've also included my progress in this repository if you wanted to check it out for yourself and provide any feedback.
